hello there, let's go through the in's and out's of webrtc within this blog, article whatever you call it. my main goal in this is for me to understand all of the components of webrtc and also understand stuff like WHIP and WHEM which has been confusing me very much becasue idk how they are connected to webrtc exactly, so hopefully this will become the guide that i wished i had when i started learning and looking into webrtc, the end goal is to create a webrtc streamer from a device through cloudflare and then directly stream into gemini live api and then get responses from that, a bit of a big feet (correct feat? :skull), lets see how this goes!.
